Here is the new Minecraft Launcher. GLauncher is created to run adventures modpacks, technican modpacks and other modpacks.

Currently in the launcher we have:
- Microsoft Login
- Non premium login (Probably will be deleted)
- Automatic java downloader
What i want to add:
- Normal Version Launching and Optifine
- Better look
- More modpacks (if you want to place your modpack in my launcher just write to me)
